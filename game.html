<!---
As logic stands you couldn't meet a man
Who's from the future
But logic broke as he appeared he spoke
About the Future
"We're not gonna make it" He explained how
The end will come, you and me were never meant
To be part of the future,
All we have is now,
All we've ever had was now
All we have is now
All we'll ever have is now

I noticed that he had a watch and hat
That looked familiar
He was me, from a dimension torn free
Of the future
"We're not gonna make it" He explained how
The end will come, you and me were never meant
To be part of the future,
All we have is now,
All we've ever had was now
All we have is now
All we'll ever have is now

All we have is now
